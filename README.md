# Qt Media Library Abstraction

This is a simple wrapper around a multimedia playback library. It currently wraps only QtAV.

Defining `MEDIA_QTAV` is required. `MEDIA_AUDIOONLY` can be defined if the application does not need video.

You can use this library under the MIT license and at your own risk. If you do, you're welcome contributing your changes and fixes.
